Program description:
--------------------------------------
This project came about when a friend told me she was making request for data to a web API
one at a time for a paper she was writing. I told her I could write a code that could
automate the process. This involved making a network connection to the website and using its
API to get the data I needed. Also the website returned data in XML format which I had to
parse into a CSV. I took up this project right after my first class in Java and it was
awesome to be able to use what I learnt in the classroom to do something practical.
